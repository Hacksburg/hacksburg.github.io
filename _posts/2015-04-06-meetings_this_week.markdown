Hello everyone! Tomorrow, we'll be having a board meeting at 7 and a general meeting at 7:30, as usual. We'll be talking about upcoming events, such as Solstice Fest and board member elections. The full agenda is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-04-07).

Last night, we started work on building our 3D printer kit we received last week, and we're about 60% finished. We plan to finish it tomorrow evening; if you're interested, come out and join us!
