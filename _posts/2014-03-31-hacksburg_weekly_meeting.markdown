Hello everyone! We're planning to have an informational session to kick 
things off, tomorrow (Tuesday, April 1) at 8 PM at the Retreat 
conference room in the Hacksburg building (2200 Kraft Drive, Suite 
1500). We'll be talking about the organizational structure we've come up 
with, opportunities to get further involved in Hacksburg, and some 
upcoming things we need to do. 

The backup venue -- in case we don't get the conference room, or if the 
conference room proves to small to meet in -- will be to meet in the 
space (Suite 1475). We'll have people at the building doors to let 
people in before the meeting starts; text 540-904-1701 after that. 

Hope to see you there!
