Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-01-10_general_meeting). Tonight should be light on business. If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

Also, as a reminder, next week (1/17) at 8 PM is our next Tool Tuesday! John Lewis will be teaching us the basics of using an oscilloscope to test electronics. Admission is, as always, free.

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
