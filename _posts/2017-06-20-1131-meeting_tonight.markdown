Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-06-20_general_meeting).

At 1 PM this Saturday, we'll be having our [intro woodworking class](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/events:woodworking_101_-_2017). For $10 ($5 for members), you'll be trained on the usage and safety on our wide variety of woodworking tools while making one of two small projects to take home! All levels of experience are welcome!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you at the space!
