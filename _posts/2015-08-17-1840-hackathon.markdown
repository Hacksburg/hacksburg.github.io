We are excited to say we are hosting a hackaton on Saturday September 5, 2015 from 9am to 9pm - with demos 9pm-10pm

Breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks included for $20 members and $30 non members.

Come show us what you've got!

Individuals or teams can hack for 12 hours in our space, then show off what they accomplished. It is a great opportunity to start (and maybe finish) a project you have been meaning to do but keep putting off!

At Hacksburg 2200 Kraft Drive, Suite 1475, Blacksburg, VA

Admission is $20 for members, $30 for non members.

Tickets can be purchased [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hackathon-tickets-18036724328), and covers the following:

  * Breakfast from Carol Lee Donuts
  * Drinks and Snacks (tea, coffee, water, fruit)
  * Lunch from Jimmy John's
  * Pizza Dinner

There is also the potential of a welding class occurring during the hackathon - if there is enough interest, there would be an additional fee. Please contact us if you are interested.
