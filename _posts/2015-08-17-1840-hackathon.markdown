We are excited to say we are hosting a hackathon at Hacksburg on Saturday, September 5th!

Individuals or teams can hack for 12 hours in our space, then show off what they accomplished. It is a great opportunity to start (and maybe finish) a project you have been meaning to do but keep putting off!

The hackathon will run from 9am to 9pm, with demos from 9pm-10pm. Come show us what you've got!

Admission is $20 for members, $30 for non members. Tickets can be purchased [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hackathon-tickets-18036724328), and covers the following:

  * Breakfast from Carol Lee Donuts
  * Drinks and Snacks (tea, coffee, water, fruit)
  * Lunch from Jimmy John's
  * Pizza Dinner

There is also the potential of a welding class occurring during the hackathon. If there is enough interest, there would be an additional fee. Please contact us if you are interested.
