We are excited to say we are hosting a hackaton on Saturday September 5, 2015 from 9am to 9pm - with demos 9pm-10pm

Breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks included for $20 members and $30 non members.

Come show us what you've got!

Individuals or teams can hack for 12 hours in our space, then show off what they accomplished. It is a great opportunity to start (and maybe finish) a project you have been meaning to do but keep putting off!

$20 members

$30 non members
