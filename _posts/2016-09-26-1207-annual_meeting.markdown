Hello everyone! Virginia law requires us to have an annual meeting. As such, we have decided to schedule our annual meeting for Tuesday, November 15th at 7:30 PM at the space. Annual meetings are where we review the bylaws, fill vacant officer positions, get reports on Hacksburg business, and entertain proposals germane to Hacksburg's mission. If you have an active full Hacksburg membership, you are free to vote on business proposed at this meeting.

Hope to see you there!
