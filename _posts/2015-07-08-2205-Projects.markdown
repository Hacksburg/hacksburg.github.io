I wanted to let you all know some projects that are happening in / for the space and ideas we are kicking around.

A camera!
Thanks to Kurt - here is what he had to say
Live from Hacksburg
This week, Hacksburg added a live video feed overlooking our work space in the CRC. To view the feed, visit the front page of our wiki, [http://wiki.hacksburg.org/](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/). The system consists of a USB webcam, a powered USB hub and a Raspberry Pi Model B+. A USB hub is used to provide the option for additional high current USB devices, as the Raspberry Pi has a 600 mA limit by default. The open source software package, 'mjpg-streamer', provides a low latency video stream with adjustable frame rate and resolution (an important feature when running on a device with limited computing power!). At present the feed refreshes three times per second at a resolution of 640x480 using approximately 35% of the Pi’s computing power. 

Sewing!
OK it make not seem hackerspace at first but since hackerspace are about making, breaking, building it fits. I moved my sewing machine into the space - picked up some cool fabrics - and have started marking skirts. It seems I will need to grab an iron as well! maybe a mini ironing board. But it's better than trying to work on it at home.

Domain registrar change – we are migrating to a new registrar [https://www.gandi.net/](https://www.gandi.net/) as they allow multiple people to manage a domain – so if the site gets flakey temporarily don't worry we will be back!

We have setup a donate button on the bottom of the sidebar (right hand side) if you want to donate we'd certainly appreciate it and use it to help keep the space running and try to get more things!

For example there is an arc welder going for auction on saturday.

You can now pay online – hate writing checks? You can now sign up for recurring paypal payments for your membership dues! [http://wiki.hacksburg.org/membership_steps](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/membership_steps)

Shelves
We are looking to build some shelves to help clean up the space (or maybe we can score some at the upcoming auction) either way estimates are 100$ each or 250$ depending how we construct them (thanks Mike for figuring out costs!) out of 2x4 and plywood sheets.
