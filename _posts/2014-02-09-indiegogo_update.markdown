Hey everyone! We're halfway through the campaign, and we're so grateful for all of your help! We've now raised $1600 beyond our goal, and with a week to go! Even considering the possibility of high insurance costs, we're confident now that we'll be able to cover everything necessary for the basics.

We're so excited to bring Blacksburg its first makerspace, and every donation from here on will go toward buying the things our community wants - fabrication tools, furniture, lockers, electronics: whatever it is that you all want out of a makerspace, that's what we're aiming for.

This means that the awesomeness of our space is now directly proportional to your donations, so if you know anyone who might be interested in a Blacksburg hackerspace, send them to [campaign.hacksburg.org](http://campaign.hacksburg.org)!
