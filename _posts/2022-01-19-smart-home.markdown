Smart outlets and home automation are becoming more popular every year, but these devices are often lacking some advanced features and have undesirable connections to the Internet. In this class weâ€™ll show you how to take control of your own smart outlets using software like ESPHome and Home Assistant. Bring your own Raspberry Pi or use one of our demo setups. Bring your own laptop.

This class will be in-person and online.

**Time**: January 23 from 1:00PM-4:00PM.

**Location**: Hacksburg; 1872 Pratt Drive Suite 1620. Park and enter at back of the building. Mask or other suitable face covering required.

**Online**: Online attendees can join at https://meet.hacksburg.org/class .

**Cost**: Free for Hacksburg members, $5 for non-members.

**RSVP**: Email [rsvp@hacksburg.org](https://hb.gy/YBbRu) or sign up on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/HacksburgVA/events/282573577)!
