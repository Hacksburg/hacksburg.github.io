Greetings, everyone! I have several pieces of good news for you all:

  * The Printrbot kit has been funded, thanks to a single generous donator! We'll be ordering it in the next week or two and setting up a build party some time later. We'll announce it in the blog when that happens.
  * Hacksburg will be celebrating its 1st birthday a week from Tuesday, on March 31st, and we're going to have a party! We plan to have pizza at 7 and cake at 8, so come on down for some food and socializing!
  * Ideas are still brewing for [our booth for Solstice Fest](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/summer_2015_booth)! We'll be meeting at Hacksburg to discuss it this Tuesday after our 7:30 PM regular meeting. Last week, Ben knocked together a prototype of a capacitive sensor, and more is to come!
  
It's a time of good things happening for Hacksburg, with more yet to come! We hope you can join us!

**PS:** We'll be having meetings as usual this week on Tuesday (3/24) at the space -- Board meeting at 7 PM, regular meeting at 7:30, Come out and join us!
