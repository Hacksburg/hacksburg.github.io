Hello everyone! We'll be having a board meeting at 7 and a general meeting at 7:30, as usual. No 3D printer meeting, but we'll be talking about Solstice Fest, getting the Printrbot, and our Adafruit group buy. The agenda for the meeting is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-03-17).

Hope to see you there!
