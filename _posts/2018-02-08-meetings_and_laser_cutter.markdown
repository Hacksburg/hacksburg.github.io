Hey all,

As a reminder, we have our regularly scheduled open meetings on Tuesdays at 7:30, and we will announce if for some reason we are not having them, such as during inclement weather and holidays. These meetings are open to all to attend. Anyone is welcome to check out our space during these times!

Also, we will be setting up our laser cutter this weekend on Saturday at 1pm, so if you'd like to drop by the space and lend a hand or just would like a look around, Hacksburg will be open then as well!
