Hello everyone! 

We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-11-08_general_meeting). We'll be discussing upcoming events and elections happening at this year's annual meeting. If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

As a reminder, next week (November 15th) we will not be having a regular meeting, but rather our Annual Meeting. There, we'll be going over the Bylaws, holding elections for the Board of Directors, and going over other organizational business. Anyone is entitled to attend; current members will be entitled to vote on business.

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
