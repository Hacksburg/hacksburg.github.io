Hello everyone! Tonight, we'll be having a board meeting at 7 and a general meeting at 7:30, as usual. The full agenda is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-04-14).

Last week, we finished building our 3D printer! It still needs some tweaking before it can be used, but we anticipate finishing that by tonight. If you're interested in learning more about 3D printing, feel free to come out and take a look!
