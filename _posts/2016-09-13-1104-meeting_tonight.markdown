Hello everyone! We have a few things to go over today:

  * We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-09-13_general_meeting). We'll be discussing upcoming events, what we did at recent events, and other things. We'll also be doing project show-and-tell, giving tours, helping each other troubleshoot projects, and answering questions about the space. If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!
  * Our [second annual Unconference](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/unconference_ii) is this Saturday (9/17), starting at 10 AM at the space. This is a gathering of makers, hackers, and crafters from all around the nation to come together and talk about the projects that interest them, and for others to share their experiences. We'd love for you to bring your knowledge to the table! The cost is $20, which includes lunch, and you'll get to meet a lot of awesome people!
  * As a reminder, this Thursday, September 15th, we'll be shutting down our Google Group, as nobody seems to be using it.  You can find other ways to get in touch with Hacksburg and its members [here](http://hacksburg.org/contact.html).

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
