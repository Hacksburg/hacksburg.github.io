This past weekend, Saturday September 17, Hacksburg hosted our second Hacker Unconference.

What was it? A bunch of people interested in technology who got together to talk about whatever things they were passionate about.

We ended up with the following schedule:

  * How the Internet works - really
  * Attach in Depth - new cyber methods as seen in russia's sucessful attack on power infrastructure
  * All te drones! (Racing, AP, lon range FPV, build, design)
  * Hacking Power Meters
  
If any speakers want to let us know links to projects discussed or further materials we would be glad to link them.
