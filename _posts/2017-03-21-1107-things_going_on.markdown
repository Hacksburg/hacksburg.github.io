Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-03-21_general_meeting). As always, we'll be conducting business, answering newcomers' questions about the space, and helping each other out with projects; feel free to stop on by. :-)

And as a reminder, tonight at 8 PM is Tool Tuesday, where yours truly (Andrew Mike) will be teaching people how to use a 3D printer! If you've ever been curious about 3D printing, tonight is the night to come by!

Finally, there's just one week to go for our [Adafruit Group Buy](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/adafruit_group_buy)! If you want to buy something from Adafruit, you only have one week left to get your orders in!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
