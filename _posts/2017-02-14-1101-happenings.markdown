Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-02-14_general_meeting). As always, we'll be conducting business, answering newcomers' questions about the space, and helping each other out with projects; feel free to stop on by. :-)

Next week, will be our Tool Tuesday, where Brent Michalowski will be teaching people how to solder! If you've ever wanted to make electronics but didn't know where to start, this is a great skill to have.

Finally, we're halfway through our [Witch and Wizard Wand Contest](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/events:2017:magic_wand_contest)! Channel your inner wizard by making a magic wand that will wow our members! Prizes will be awarded in multiple categories. More details at the link above.


Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
