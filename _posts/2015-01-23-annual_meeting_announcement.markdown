Greetings!

Virginia law requires us to have an annual meeting every year, so we're going to have one on **Tuesday, February 10th at 8 PM at the space.** The agenda for the meeting is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2014-15_annual_meeting). If there's anything you'd like to add, feel free; it is a wiki, after all.

Hope to see you there!
