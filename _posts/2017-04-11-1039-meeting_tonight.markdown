Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-04-11_general_meeting). If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

Our propmaking class last Saturday was a huge success! We had a dozen people show up to make props of various sizes and complexities. A big thanks to Will Tilson and Cameron Woodruff for organizing the class and making it happen!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
