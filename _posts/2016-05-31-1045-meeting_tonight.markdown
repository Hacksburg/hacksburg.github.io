Hello everyone! 

Tonight, we'll have our general meeting at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-05-31_general_meeting). We'll be discussing upcoming events and plans for Summer Solstice Fest. As a reminder, **the deadline for placing orders for our Adafruit group buy ends in 10 days.** If you wish to place an order, follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/adafruit_wish_list).

As always, we'll also be talking about what we've worked on the past week, so feel free to bring your projects (or pics thereof) for show-and-tell. After the meeting, we will, as usual, have our open work session, where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on or hang out with like-minded makers.

Hope to see you there!
