Happy 2014, everyone! Hopefully everyone's having a great holiday! Chances are most of you have been following the Facebook group and know what's going on, but in case you're not...

For the last several months, we've been operating in stealth mode getting various organizational things together. I'm pleased to report that we've become an official Virginia Non-Stock Corporation with a Tax ID and a bank account, so we can actually transact business as a corporate entity and not just a gaggle of peoples. Not long after this, we got wind of a potential site for the hackerspace, and we opted to check it out. The space looks good, and we think we have a plan that will let us rent the space and make the group sustainable. It's this plan that we want to discuss at a meeting tomorrow. 

The meeting is tomorrow starting at 8:30 PM at the Blacksburg Library, located at 200 Miller Street. We'll be discussing several key points of business. If you've been interested in having this hackerspace get off the ground, this meeting is the one to go to.

Hope to see you there!
