Got a 3D printer and have questions? Something doesn't work? Want to make your printer harder, better, faster or stronger? Want to help us improve our own printer? This event offers a shared work day for community members and Hacksburg itself to work on and improve our 3D printers. All knowledge levels welcome.

Ages 16+. Minors will need to have parent/guardian supervision for the **entire duration** of the class, and parent/guardian must approve all activity.

In addition to projects by attendees, Hacksburg will be working on upgrading our own Creality CR-10 S4. We will also be teaching attendees about the basics of 3D printers and 3D print post-processing techniques.

**Time**: September 19 from 1:00PM to 4:00PM

**Location**: Hacksburg; 1872 Pratt Drive Suite 1700 (the laser room). Park and enter at back of the building. Masks or other suitable face coverings required for in-person attendance.

**Cost**: $5 for non-members and free for Hacksburg members.

**RSVP**: No RSVP required.
