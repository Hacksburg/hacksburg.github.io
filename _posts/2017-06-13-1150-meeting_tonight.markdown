Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-06-13_general_meeting).

Tonight we'll be discussing preparations for our booth at [Summer Solstice Fest](http://www.downtownblacksburg.com/summer-solstice-blacksburg.aspx), which is **this Saturday!** Please feel free to stop by and see us -- we'll be doing demonstrations and answering questions people have about Hacksburg. If you want to help us with this, there's still time; just sign up on the Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bIzbywxSBwDcmI_cKEa8fh9w5_eL84KqhIe3gdHiOJU/edit#gid=0).

In any event, we hope to see you all tonight and Saturday!
