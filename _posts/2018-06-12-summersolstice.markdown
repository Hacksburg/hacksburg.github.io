This Saturday is Summer Solstice Fest in Downtown Blacksburg! Hacksburg has a booth (on Lee St near Cabo Fish Taco). Please drop by and see us! If you'd like to help out at the booth, volunteer shifts can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1diXhiKy1llfVclKneVLTKRPYTkV90R1C-OAlnX2x6tA/edit?usp=sharing)

Sunday, after Summer Solstice, we will have an open house. Please drop by for that as well, to check out the space, show cool projects off, and meet members of the maker community here in the New River Valley! Hours are 1pm to 5pm.
