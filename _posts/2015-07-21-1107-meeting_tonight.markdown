Hello everyone! Tonight, we'll be having a board meeting at 7 and a general meeting at 7:30. The agenda is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-07-21). With our big July events behind us, we'll be talking about future projects and prepping for events in August. Come and join us!

Also, we're conducting a hardware wishlist survey. If you've ever thought that Hacksburg didn't have what you were looking for for a project, we're interested in your input.
