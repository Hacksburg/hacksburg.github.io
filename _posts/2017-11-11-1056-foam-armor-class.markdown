Learn about making foam armor and make your own bracer to take home. We'll go over the basics of foam armor making, have a hands-on demo, and wrap up with a question and answer session. 

The class costs $10 to cover materials. If you can, please bring a heat gun, EVA foam, and concept photos for the Q&A.
