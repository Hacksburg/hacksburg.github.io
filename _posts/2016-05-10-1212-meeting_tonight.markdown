Hello everyone! 

Tonight, we'll have our general meeting at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-05-10_general_meeting). We'll be discussing upcoming events and plans for Summer Solstice Fest. As always, we'll also be talking about what we've worked on the past week, so feel free to bring your projects (or pics thereof) for show-and-tell. After the meeting, we will, as usual, have our open work session, where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on or hang out with like-minded makers.

Hope to see you there!
