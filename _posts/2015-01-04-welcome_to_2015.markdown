Hello everyone! I hope you all had a great generic winter holiday!

First, as usual we'll be having our meetings as scheduled on January 6th -- Board Meeting at 7 PM, General Meeting at 7:30. We've got a few business items to talk about. The agenda for the general meeting can be found [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-01-06).

Also, we'll be having a work session at 8 PM, as well as our first 3D printer meeting of the year. We've received the electronics for the 3D printer, so exciting things will be happening!

Finally, as we head into 2015, we will need support more than ever to deal with operating expenses and to get the 3D printer operational. If you've been thinking about becoming a member, now's the time. See [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/membership_steps) for more details.

Thanks, as always, for your support, and here's to a great year!
