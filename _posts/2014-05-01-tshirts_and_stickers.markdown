Hey everyone,

We're have t-shirt designs and we're almost ready to order them. They will be $17 per shirt and printed local in Blacksburg on Gildan t-shirts. What we need is some input from you: Specifically, sizes! We've created a survey that can be found [here] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FhjwTpiil8KE1rHppFmEYEaRX01aA_y9AnC3apffd9k/viewform?usp=send_form). Please fill this out if you contributed to the Indiegogo campaign and are receiving a short or if you want to buy one. If you don't, we may not order many extras and you'll miss out on having a sweet Hacksburg t-shirt to impress friends with! We want to order these ASAP, so fill it out!

We are also please to announce that our bumper stickers are in, and available for $10. It looks pretty awesome on my car, and I'll get some action shots for you later.
