An important aspect of Hacksburg is our community Tuesday meetings. Every Tuesday at 7:30PM, we meet to discuss Hacksburg business and let members show off their projects.
In order to encourage social distancing related to COVID-19, Tuesday meetings will not be held in person, but held online. Meetings will retain the same format and content.
Hacksburg meetings and classes are held on our Jitsi Meet server, and the URL for our Tuesday meetings is <https://meet.hacksburg.org/OpenGroupMeeting>.
If you have any connection issues, please reach out to [board@hacksburg.org](mailto:board@hacksburg.org).
