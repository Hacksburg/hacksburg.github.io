As a 501(c)(3) non profit organization did you know you can support Hacksburg each time you shop on Amazon using [Amazon Smile](https://smile.amazon.com/)?

If you already use Amazon Smile here are directions to [change your charitable organization](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201365360).

If you often forget to use Amazon Smile here are some browser extensions to help you out:
  * [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amazonsmileredirector/)
  * [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smile-always/jgpmhnmjbhgkhpbgelalfpplebgfjmbf?hl=en)
  * [Safari](http://distrustsimplicity.net/articles/keep-on-smiling/)
  
As always we also accept [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KVUGMTXUKKPAQ), cash, check, and participate in [Give Big New River Valley](https://cfnrv.givebig.org/c/NRV/a/hacksburg). We also are frequently looking for equipment so donations of equipment are also tax deductible!
