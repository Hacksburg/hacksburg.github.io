Hello everyone! 

We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-10-11_general_meeting). We'll be discussing upcoming events and elections happening at this year's annual meeting. Also tonight, Brent Michalowski will be showing us how to use his new CNC machine! If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
