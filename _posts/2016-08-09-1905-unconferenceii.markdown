Hey everyone, just a reminder that the Hacksburg Unconference II is on Saturday, September 17 at 10 AM - 4 PM.

Last year we ended up with the following schedule:

  * Microfluidics lab-on-a-chip
  * Cable modem crash course
  * Quad copter racing
  * Software Defined Radio
  * Discuss - how to map caves with robots
  * Camera hacking
  * Wandering about looking for Bluetooth Low Energy devices that were broadcasting
