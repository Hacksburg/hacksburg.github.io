Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-02-28_general_meeting). If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

Also, tonight is the **last night** to enter your wand in Hacksburg's [Witch and Wizard Wand Contest](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/events:2017:magic_wand_contest)! Once all the entries are in, we'll be picking the winners at our Magic Wand Party on March 7th at 8 PM! Anyone can attend, but only members can vote!

Finally, this Saturday (March 4th) we'll be holding a beginner's sewing class from 1-4 PM at the space! Come join Nicole Schwartz to learn the basics of sewing, and make a bag to take home! Cost is $5 for members, $10 for non-members.

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
