As of today, Hacksburg is offering lower rates to students enrolled in local universities.

Student members will pay 20% less than the normal membership dues: $40/month, $96/quarter, or $240/year.
If you're a student who wants space to work on cool projects, this is a perfect time to join Hacksburg!
