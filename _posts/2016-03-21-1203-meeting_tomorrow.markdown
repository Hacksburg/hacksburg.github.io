Hello everyone! 

Tomorrow we'll be having our general meeting at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-03-22_general_meeting). 

We'll be discussing upcoming events, including our upcoming cosplay class series. Don't forget to bring any recent projects (or pictures) to show off in our "What you are working on" section of the meeting. After the meeting, we will, as usual, have our open work session, where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on or hang out with like-minded makers. We hope you can join us!
