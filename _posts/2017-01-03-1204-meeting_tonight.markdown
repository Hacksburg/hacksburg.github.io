Hello everyone! On behalf of Hacksburg, we hope that everyone has had a good winter holiday. 2016 is finally over, and we have a lot planned for 2017. We're excited about it, and we hope you are too!

We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-01-03_general_meeting). Tonight should be light on business. If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
