Work on the 3D printer continues! We ordered the electronics last week, so hopefully they should be here by the meeting. If so, we'll be checking them out. If not, we'll have some more discussion on what model to build.

We decided last meeting that we're going to build a model based on the [Prusa i3](http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa) or a similar T-framed model. It may be the i3 itself or one of its derivatives, depending on what the group feels is best. We value everyone's input, so we hope to see you there!
