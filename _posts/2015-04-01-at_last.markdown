For the longest time, we've been waiting to acquire something. And now, it's finally here.

We now have a death ray!

Though it being a kit, it needs some assembly. So come on down this Sunday at 8 PM for the death ray build party! We'll need lots of mini--er, volunteers to come help us! Especially with that fission battery...yeesh, did they *have* to use 2 feet of lead for the entire casing?

Anyway, this is a historic event as we become the first hackerspace to have the power TO RULE THE--erm, to have a death ray! Hope to see you there!
