Hello everyone! 

We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-12-20_general_meeting). 

In addition, tonight at 8 PM will be our second Tool Tuesday! This regular event will showcase a tool or piece of equipment at the space, showing how it works, what you can do with it, and so on. Tonight, Brent Michalowski will be showing off the laser engraver, how to use it, and what awesome designs he's made with it. It should be fun, so come on down!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
