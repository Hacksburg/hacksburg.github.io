Hacksburg will be holding our Cloud and Personal Websites class on Sunday November 8 from 1:00PM-4:00PM.
Attendees will learn what the cloud is, what it isn't, and how they can use cloud services.
During the class, attendees will use the Hacksburg member cloud, so no third-party cloud accounts are required.
We will also go over the steps to setup a personal website.

The class will be held online using Jitsi Meet. Please RSVP if you're planning on attending by sending an email to [rsvp@hacksburg.org](mailto:rsvp@hacksburg.org). The stream will be available at the URL listed below.
