As you may have heard, Hacksburg got approved to display at Solstice Fest on June 20th. We're glad to participate in this, and we have an awesome booth in the making! In order to make that happen, though, we need volunteers to help set up and tear down the booth, hand out flyers, make sure people don't hurt themselves on our exhibit, *et cetera*.

In order to coordinate schedules, we've created a Doodle for volunteers to indicate what hours they're available to work [here](http://doodle.com/9r642p2cwcedy25n). If you can help at all, please do. Even an hour of your time would be greatly beneficial.

Thanks for your support, and we hope to see you there!
