Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-03-28_general_meeting). If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

As a reminder, tonight is the last night to get in on the [Adafruit Group Buy](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/adafruit_group_buy). The spreadsheet will be **locked** at 7:30 PM tonight, so get those orders in!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
