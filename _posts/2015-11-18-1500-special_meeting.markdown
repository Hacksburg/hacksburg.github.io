In the 18 months that Hacksburg has been around, it's seen considerable change, and the bylaws have not kept up with those changes. We hope to fix that on December 1st, when we will hold a special meeting at 8 PM to vote on changes to these bylaws.

First, we want to eliminate some constraints about membership dues so we can innovate with different pricing structures at a faster pace than the bylaws change process allows by putting it (and some other info about the membership process) into a separate policy. We also want to remove some constraints around scheduling annual meetings so that we can hold it whenever it is appropriate instead of waiting until the end of the year, when many are dealing with the winter holidays.

We're also proposing some changes regarding officer and Board positions. The office of Steward was established early on when we had a much more involved process for giving someone 24-hour access to the space. This quickly proved to be more trouble than it was worth, so we scrapped it, but the Steward office remained. We want to abolish it.

Finally, we want to relax qualifications for being a member of the Board of Directors. Right now, in order to be on the Board, someone has to be a member in good standing for a contiguous period of a year and a day. We want to change that to a month, in order to better fill vacancies on the Board.

Those are the broad strokes of the changes. The full set can be found [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/policy:proposed_bylaws_changes_2015-12-01). If you're a voting member, I urge you to come out and get involved. If there are questions about these proposed changes, feel free to email the board at board at hacksburg dot org.
