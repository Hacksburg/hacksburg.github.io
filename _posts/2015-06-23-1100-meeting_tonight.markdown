Hello everyone! Our booth at Summer Solstice Fest was a big hit! Despite the rain, there was a lot of interest, which made it very worthwhile. Thanks to everyone who volunteered -- Jenn McGuire, Hunter Morgan, Lyle Evans, Mike Newsome, and Ava Pope -- for helping to make it a success!

Tonight, we'll be having a board meeting at 7 and a general meeting at 7:30. There's no agenda at present, as the wiki is currently down; however, we'll be welcoming new people, planning new events, and working on various side projects. Come and join us!

**Update 18:26:** The agenda is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-06-23).
