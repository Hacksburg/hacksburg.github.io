Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-05-02_general_meeting). If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

Also, tonight at 8 PM is our Steampunk tea party! There will be tea (of course), scones, and a smashing good time as the members decide on the best steampunk accoutrements made by the entrants! All entries **must** be submitted before the party starts!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
