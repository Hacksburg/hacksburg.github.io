Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-03-07_general_meeting). If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

Also, tonight at 8 PM is the awards party for the Witch and Wizard Wand Contest! There will be chocolate frogs, (non-alcoholic) butterbeer, and lots of fun times as the members decide which wands go with which awards! All wands **must** be submitted before the party starts!

Finally, today is the start of our next Adafruit Group Buy! If you've ever wanted something from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) and were waffling over pulling the trigger, we may be able to help you get it at a reduced price! More info on the wiki page [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/adafruit_group_buy).

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
