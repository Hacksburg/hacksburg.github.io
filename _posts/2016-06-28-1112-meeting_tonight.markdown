Hello everyone!

We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-06-28_general_meeting). As always, we'll also be talking about what we've worked on the past week, so feel free to bring your projects (or pics thereof) for show-and-tell. After the meeting, we will, as usual, have our open work session, where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on or hang out with like-minded makers.

As a reminder, today is the last day -- no, really -- for orders for our [Adafruit group buy](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/adafruit_wish_list). We will be locking down the spreadsheet at 8 PM tonight, and after that no further orders will be taken. This is probably the last group buy we'll do for a while, given the flagging interest, so if you've been wanting something from Adafruit, now's the time.
