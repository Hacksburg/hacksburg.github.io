Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-11-28_general_meeting). We will be discussing the placement and setup of the new laser cutter among other things. 

As always, these meetings are free and open to the public at large, where you can get tours of the space and its equipment, ask questions about the space, see what business we conduct, and so forth. If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!
