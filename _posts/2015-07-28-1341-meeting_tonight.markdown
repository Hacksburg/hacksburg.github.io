Hello everyone! Tonight, we'll be having a board meeting at 7 and a general meeting at 7:30. The agenda is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-07-28). We'll be talking about upcoming events, new developments with the space, and we'll be cleaning up the back room and installing [the new shelves we built this past weekend](http://hacksburg.org/2015/07/27/1800-ShelfFest.html). Come and join us!
