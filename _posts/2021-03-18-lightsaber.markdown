Hacksburg is holding a joint class with the Lightsaber Club at Virginia Tech to make lightsabers!
Attendees will watch one lightsaber hilt being made on the lathe on April 24, and participate one at a time to encourage social distancing.
Each lightsaber hilt will take several hours to complete, so attendees will make the hilts after the class on their own time.
Non-members can sign up for a timeslot to come into Hacksburg to work, and members can work at any time.

If you'd like to attend, please sign up by filling out this form: <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2-JhKSltOgvqwiRrUdk3a_BzA8HRRo1XKkc1Ur1be4o_R0Q/viewform?usp=sf_link>

Please RSVP by **April 10** so we have time to purchase materials.

**Time**: Saturday, April 24 from 1:00PM to 4:00PM

**Location**: At Hacksburg. One attendee at a time will be at the lathe, while others are scattered within the building watching a video feed to encourage social distancing. Everyone will be able to ask questions as the machining proceeds.

**Cost**: Varies. This class has a considerable material cost, which is given in the form listed above.

**RSVP**: RSVP by filling out the form listed above.
