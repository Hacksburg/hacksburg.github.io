Hello everyone! 

Tonight, we'll have our general meeting at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-02-09_general_meeting). 

We'll be discussing upcoming events and ideas for Summer Solstice Fest. After the meeting, we will, as usual, have our open work session, where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on, work on a car for [our upcoming Hackwood Derby](http://hacksburg.org/2016/02/02/1431-hackwood-derby.html), or hang out with like-minded makers.

We hope you can join us!
