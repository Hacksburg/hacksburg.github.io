Hello, everyone! We have a lot going on this month:

  * First, we'll be having our weekly meeting tonight at 7:30 PM. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-12-06_general_meeting). We have a lot to discuss, including upcoming events for December and the progress of ongoing campaigns, so come join us!
  * This Sunday afternoon, from 1-4 PM, we're having an [Open House](https://www.facebook.com/events/336445393401964/) for those interested in taking an in-depth tour of the space and to see it in action. Refreshments will be provided.
  * Starting this month, we'll be having a new regular event -- Tool Tuesday! One Tuesday a month, we'll be taking some time after our regular meeting to showcase a piece of equipment in the space and demonstrate its use. To kick this off, we'll be having two Tool Tuesdays in December! The first will be on [December 13th](https://www.facebook.com/events/1223800154377692/), where Will Tilson will be doing a demonstration of the metal lathe he brought into the space recently. The following week, on [December 20th](https://www.facebook.com/events/202687426858421/), Brent Michalowski will be showing us the many things you can do with a laser engraver. Both are bound to be exciting, so I hope you can come out and see them!
  
Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you at the space!
