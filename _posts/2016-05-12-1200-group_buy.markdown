Hello everyone! 

We are doing another [adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) group buy. The idea is that you pick out what you want and we put it on the list to order and if the order is large enough we get a discount. Payment will be due when the order is placed. The discount varies by item, but typically is 30% of retail price. Not everything gets a discount â€“ most test equipment, 3D printers and supplies, and dev boards don't, for instance. But many components, Arduino shields, displays, sensors, and accessories do get the discount.

Timeline:
 * Now-June 10: Potential buyers get their orders in.
 * June 10, 5PM EDT: Deadline for new orders. Google doc is protected, and items are checked for availability.
 * June 17, 7:30 PM EDT: Adafruit finalization meeting. Confirmed buyers come to Hacksburg to finalize orders and pay. Adafruit order is placed that night.
 * Late June/Early July: Order arrives at Hacksburg and is divided by buyer; buyers notified to pick up orders at the next Hacksburg meeting.
