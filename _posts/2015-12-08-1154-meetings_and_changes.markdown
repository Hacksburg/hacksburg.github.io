Hello everyone! Tonight, we'll have our general meeting at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-12-08). 

We'll be talking about upcoming events and projects we've worked on. Hope you can join us!

In addition, we've made a couple of changes recently:

* First, at our [special meeting on December 1st](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-12-01#special_meeting), the [proposed Bylaws changes](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/policy:proposed_bylaws_changes_2015-12-01) passed by a unanimous vote. Therefore, the changes have been incorporated into our Bylaws, which you can view [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/policy:bylaws).
* Second, thanks to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) entering [its long-awaited public beta](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/12/03/entering-public-beta.html), Hacksburg now has SSL certificates for our websites! For now, this only affects the wiki, as well as a few internal sites; in the future, we may make more resources available to both members and non-members. Meanwhile, if you have an account on our wiki, we'd recommend changing your password.
