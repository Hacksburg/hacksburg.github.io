Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-01-31_general_meeting). If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

In addition, tomorrow will mark the beginning of the Hacksburg Magic Wand Contest, running through the month of February! Channel your inner wizard by making a magic wand that will wow our members! Prizes will be awarded in multiple categories. More details to come!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
