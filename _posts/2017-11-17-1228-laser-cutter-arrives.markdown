Hacksburg's new laser cutter has arrived! The unit is an 80W [CAMFive CFL-CMA 2416](https://www.camfive.com/usa/index.php/camfive-laser-cutting-and-engraving-machine-cfl-cma2416k.html). Some additional setup and electrical work needs to be completed before the laser is fully operational, so stay tuned!
