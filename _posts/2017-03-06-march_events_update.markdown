Hacksburg Tool Tuesday - Introduction to 3D printing - 8:00pm
 
Come on out to Hacksburg's monthly Tool Tuesday and learn what 3D printing is, what uses it has, and the basics of doing it from Andrew, a board member.

This event is open to everyone (students, residents, anyone!) and free.

This event will follow our normal weekly meeting (which starts at 7:30pm) and will be followed by our weekly open work session - both of 

which are always open to anyone! A great time to get a tour or be able to sit down and work on a project.

Directions: 2200 Kraft Drive, Suite 1475, Blacksburg, VA

Take the right turn near the bottom of the hill, right before you get to the bank. This will bring you to the KnowledgeWorks buildings.

Continue on the road to the front of the building, then turn right and proceed to the parking lot at the far end of the building, near the bus stop and the pond.

Hacksburg is the space with the big garage door immediately to your left. If the door isn't open, knock clearly and we'll let you in.
