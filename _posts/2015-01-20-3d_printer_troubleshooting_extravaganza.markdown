Hello everyone! There will be a board meeting today at 7 PM, and then a general meeting at 7:30. The agenda for the general meeting is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-01-20).

At 8 PM we will be having our 3D printer work session, where we will be doing some troubleshooting on our print controller; the Arduino/RAMPS board is not driving the motors at all.

Hope to see everyone there!
