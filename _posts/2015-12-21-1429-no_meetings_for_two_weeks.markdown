In observance of the various winter holidays happening over the next two weeks, there will be no regular meetings or open work sessions for the next two Tuesdays (December 22nd and 29th) -- in effect, the rest of 2015. The space will be open to members as usual, though most of the Board will be out of town at various points. Our next regular meeting will happen on Tuesday, January 5th, 2016.

We hope everyone's winter holidays are joyous and festive!
