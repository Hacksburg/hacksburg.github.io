Our normal tuesday general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space is happening, followed by our usual open-to-the-public open work session (and tours!), where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on or hang out with like-minded makers.

The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-09-06_general_meeting). 

As always, we'll also be talking about what we've worked on the past week, so feel free to bring your projects (or pics thereof) for show-and-tell. 

Sorry for the delay!
