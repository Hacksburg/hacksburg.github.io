We are excited to try out a new platform, Patreon. People may submit donations and each time we produce an electronic newsletter they will be charged their pledged donation amount! We plan to have our newsletter include pictures of the space, pictures and notes about projects members have done over the month, and notes and information about any classes or events that were hosted.

If you are not a Patreon user you can of course always donate working (used) tools and equipment or money in other ways:
