Hello everyone! 

Tonight, we'll have our general meeting at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-03-08_general_meeting). 

We'll be discussing upcoming March events (Hackwood Derby, Homebrewing Demo, 3D printing Class), and making our Adafruit group buy purchase. Payments for those participating are due tonight at the meeting in cash or check. Pickup will be at the space.

Don't forget to bring any recent projects (or pictures) to show off in our "What you are working on" section.

After the meeting, we will, as usual, have our open work session, where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on, work on a car for [our upcoming Hackwood Derby](http://hacksburg.org/2016/02/02/1431-hackwood-derby.html), or hang out with like-minded makers.

We hope you can join us!
