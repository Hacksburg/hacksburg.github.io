Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-08-22_general_meeting). We'll be discussing upcoming Board elections, classes, and ongoing purchasing programs.

As always, these meetings are free and open to the public at large, where you can get tours of the space and its equipment, ask questions about the space, see what business we conduct, and so forth. If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

As a reminder, tonight we will be taking nominations for elections to the Board of Directors. Candidates must have been full members of the space for at least one month before the election to be eligible. Nominations must be accepted by the nominee before the election takes place. To nominate someone for the position, please show up at the meeting or email the Board at board at hacksburg dot org.

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
