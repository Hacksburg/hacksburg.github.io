We've heard from others that memberships were too expensive. In the past, we were concerned about the effect that reducing membership prices would have on our sustainability. At this point, however, we're willing to experiment with some tweaks to the formula. It's not an across-the-board decrease; we decided that the deep discounts we were giving longer-term memberships were unsustainable, so we've had to make them shallower.

Here is the new pricing structure:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Normal Price</th>
    <th>Student Price</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>1 month</th>
    <td>$40</td>
    <td>$32</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>3 months</th>
    <td>$108</td>
    <td>$84</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>6 months</th>
    <td>$204</td>
    <td>$156</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>12 months</th>
    <td>$384</td>
    <td>$288</td>
  </tr>
</table>

We'd appreciate your help in spreading the word about these pricing changes as far as possible. If there are any questions, please feel free to contact us at board at hacksburg dot org.
