Hello everyone! Tonight, we'll be having a board meeting at 7 and a general meeting at 7:30, as usual. The full agenda is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-04-28).

Work continues on the 3D printer and bike project for Solstice Fest. Last week, we measured the power usage on the 3D printer -- an impressive 40-45 watts! We may be adding a heated bed to the 3D pritner tonight, so come out and join us!
