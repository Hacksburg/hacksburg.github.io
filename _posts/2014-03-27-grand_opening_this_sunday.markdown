Hi folks! A quick reminder that our grand opening is this Sunday (NOT Saturday!) starting at 1 PM at our new location -- 2200 Kraft Drive, Suite 1475. Utilize your favorite navigation software for directions.

As a reminder to Indiegogo backers who pledged at the $100 and $250 levels, Sunday is when you'll get to put your handprint on the wall for the Founding High Five! (We're running out to get paint now. Seriously.) Alternatively, if you come to us after the opening and show your backer status, we can put your handprint on the wall then.

As mentioned before, those of you with Founding Memberships will have them start in April. You'll need to fill out some paperwork to claim them, but you will not be charged for the first month. Please see below for further details.

We're also pleased to announce that anyone who wants to apply for regular memberships starting in April will be able to do so starting at the Grand Opening! To speed things along, if you're wanting a membership, please fill out, print, sign, and submit both the Membership Application and Liability Waiver to us, which can be found on [this wiki page](http://hacksburg.org/wiki/index.php?title=Forms).

We will also be taking membership payments. We will be taking cash, checks, and credit cards and online payments via PayPal (ugh). We hope to replace PayPal in the future, but we don't have it ready right now.

We're all really excited that this is finally coming together. Thank you all so much for your patience and your continued support.
