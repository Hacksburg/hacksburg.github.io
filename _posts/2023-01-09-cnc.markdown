**NEW:** Barring any unforseen developments, we will be using our new Onefinity CNC Gantry router pictured above!

Hacksburg will be hosting our CNC class on Sunday, January 15.
Attendees will learn how to do basic CNC operations and think like a machinist.
This class is the first in a three-part series. This part covers operation of the machine; the second part covers CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) software; and the third part is a homework assignment for members who want to be qualified on the machine.

Please RSVP if you're planning on attending on Meetup <https://hb.gy/xPV4y> or by sending an email to [rsvp@hacksburg.org](mailto:rsvp@hacksburg.org).
