On October 7th we'll be having the second day of our [4th Annual Hacksburg Cider Making Event](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/events:2018:cider_making). 

Bring your own apples and containers and join us to make your own fresh squeezed apple cider. Click [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/events:2017:cidermaking) for more information about cider making and what to bring! Cider making is free!

You can also make a personalized laser engraved cider mug to take home - only $2. Free tours of the Hacksburg community workshop will also be offered.

Hacksburg is a makerspace. Makerspaces, also known as hackerspaces, are community spaces with tools and people who love to create and tinker with everything from electronics, wood, metal, sewing to home brew! Come check out our community of makers.
