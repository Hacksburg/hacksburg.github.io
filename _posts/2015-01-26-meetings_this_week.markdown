Hi all! Meetings as usual this week, starting with the board meeting at 7 PM and the general meeting at 7:30. General meeting agenda is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-01-27) for your perusal and/or editing.

Also, we'll hopefully be doing our 3D printer bughunt tomorrow at 8 PM. Hope to see everyone there!
