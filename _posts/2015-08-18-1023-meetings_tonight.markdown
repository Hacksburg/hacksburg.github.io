Hello everyone! 

Tonight, we'll have our general meeting at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-08-18).

In addition to discussing upcoming events, we'll also be discussing creating a policy for exclusive events. All of our events in the past have been member-oriented and either open to the public or other members. Recently, we received a request from a nonmember to have a closed event in the space. Given that events like this would make the space less available to our members, we decided that we needed a policy around such events, and it would be helpful to have member input. If you're a member and can come, please do; we'd love your input.
