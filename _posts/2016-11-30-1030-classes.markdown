Hello!

We're your neighbors in the CRC (Corporate Research Center) at 2200 Kraft Drive, Suite 1475, Blacksburg, VA Hacksburg is Blacksburgâ€™s first makerspace. A makerspace is just your dream garage, at a fraction of the cost, and full of smart people. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization consisting members (Open to anyone 18+) who can join for one month to one year at a time. Our space, which is accessible 24/7 to members, has a large assortment of tools and equipment that members can use to do their own projects, and also allows members to bounce ideas off of one another making working in the shop more fun. We also host many classes, that are open to the public, on a variety of topics through the year. 

Please come out and meet us at one of our upcoming events and do keep us in mind for end of year [donations](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/donate), we are very happy to take in kind donations of working tools and equipment or money as a 501(c)(3)non profit charitable organization.
