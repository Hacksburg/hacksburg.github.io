Our latest project, a bike that generates power through pedalling, currently has been mounted to a wooden platform, a stand for the motor has been made, and there is a belt ready to be tensioned. no battery to store energy yet!

We will have it at our table in Downtown Blacksburg at Summer Solstice Fest on Saturday June 20, 2015, 1pm- 11:30pm rain or shine.

Please check out our [Doodle](http://doodle.com/9r642p2cwcedy25n#table) to sign up as a volunteer to help at our table.
