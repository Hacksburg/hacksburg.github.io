Hello everyone! A few things to cover:

First, we'd like to thank all those who volunteered at our booth at Summer Solstice Fest last Saturday! Despite some initial hiccups, the booth was overall a success, and we had a lot of people show up to play our banana piano. So thanks to Jenn, Kurt, Brent, Lyle, and especially James, who spent many hours debugging the banana piano for our collective enjoyment!

Second, we've extended the deadline for the [Adafruit group buy](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/adafruit_wish_list) to **June 28th**, as we're still a bit short on orders that meet the $250 threshold. This will likely be the last extension; if we don't get any interest after this, the group buy will be cancelled.

Finally, we're havinga general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-06-14_general_meeting). As always, we'll also be talking about what we've worked on the past week, so feel free to bring your projects (or pics thereof) for show-and-tell. After the meeting, we will, as usual, have our open work session, where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on or hang out with like-minded makers.

Hope to see you there!
