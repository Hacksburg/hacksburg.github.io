Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. We'll be discussing the upcoming plasma sword classes and contest, [laser cutter training](https://www.facebook.com/events/365447230597604/), and World Create Day. If you have ideas for a World Create Day project, please bring them tonight!

As always, these meetings are free and open to the public at large, where you can get tours of the space and its equipment, ask questions about the space, see what business we conduct, and so forth. If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!
