Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-04-18_general_meeting). If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

As a reminder, our [steampunk contest](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/events:2017:steam_punk_contest) is still going full steam, and we'll be having an awards party on May 2nd at 8 PM to announce the winners! Get your entries in while there's still time!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
