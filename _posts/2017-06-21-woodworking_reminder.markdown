Reminder, this Saturday, we'll be having our [intro woodworking class](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/events:woodworking_101_-_2017). 

This class will cover wood shop safety and the use of common hand and power tools. Will include live demonstrations. No prior knowledge required, all experience levels welcome!

Hacksburg is a makerspace. Makerspaces, also known as hackerspaces, are community spaces with tools and people who love to create and tinker with everything from electronics, wood, metal, sewing to home brew! Come check out our community of makers.

The two projects are a tealight holder and a phone or tablet stand [see examples here](https://www.instagram.com/kurt_rooks/).
