Hello all! We'll be holding our typical meetings -- board meeting at 7, regular meeting at 7:30. The agenda for the regular meeting is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-02-03). As a reminder, we'll be having our annual meeting the following week at 8 PM; the agenda for that is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2014-15_annual_meeting).

At 8 PM, we'll be talking more about future directions for the 3D printer build, now that we have the control electronics working. We've decided on building a Prusa i3 variant; what variant we want will be discussed at the meeting. There's a list of models people have found on the wiki [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/the_search_for_a_3d_printer); feel free to take a look or propose one you've found.

Hope to see you all there!
