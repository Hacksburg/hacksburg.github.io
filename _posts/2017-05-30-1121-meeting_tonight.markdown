Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-05-30_general_meeting). If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

Also, tonight we'll be doing something different; after the meeting, we'll be sharing our favorite maker tutorial videos from YouTube! If you found a video helpful, and think others would find it helpful too, please come by and share it with us!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
