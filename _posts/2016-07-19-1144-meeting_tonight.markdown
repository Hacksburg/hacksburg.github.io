Hello everyone!

We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-07-19_general_meeting). As always, we'll also be talking about what we've worked on the past week, so feel free to bring your projects (or pics thereof) for show-and-tell. After the meeting, we will, as usual, have our open work session, where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on or hang out with like-minded makers. Hope to see you there!

As a reminder -- this Saturday, July 23rd, the space will be closed for a private event from 2-5 PM. Nobody may enter the space without express permission of the event organizer; this includes members.
