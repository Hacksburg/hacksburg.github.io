Hello everyone! 

As a reminder, tonight we will not be having a regular meeting, but rather our [Annual Meeting](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016_annual_meeting). There, we'll beholding elections for the Board of Directors and going over other organizational business. Anyone is entitled to attend; current members will be entitled to vote on business.

Hope to see you all tonight!
