We came up with some event ideas last week, and we'll be discussing more this week. Hope you can join us!

Check out our featured tool of the month - Table Saw! We have some safety videos [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/tools:woodworking).

A project idea for you cat (or rabbit) owners - [cat trees](http://www.meow-cat.com/2013/02/cat-tree-diy-tutorial-making-homemade.html) lots of table saw use to chop up your wood for the boxes!

What cool projects have you done with a table saw?
