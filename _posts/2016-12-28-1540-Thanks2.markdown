So close! We almost got a donation from Kroger.

Dear Hacksburg,

The Kroger Family of Stores is committed to bringing hope and help to local communities. We do this through a variety of activities, including charitable giving, sponsorships and the unique Community Rewards Program of Kroger. We are also committed to carefully protecting our customers' personal information. In order to meet their expectation of privacy, we have adopted a simple policy to never share a customer's personal information. Our privacy policy applies to Community Rewards participation as well. As your neighborhood food retailer, we deeply value our ability to support local organizations like yours.

Your supporters (3 households) who shopped at Kroger between 9-1-2016 and 11-30-2016 (Cycle 9, Qtr 1 2016 2017) have contributed to your $24.40 total donation. Because your total quarterly contribution is less than $25, which is the minimum check amount, you will not be receiving a check at this time. This amount will be held and combined with your next quarter's contribution total until your contribution amount exceeds $25. At the time your total contribution reaches $25, or at the end of the next program term, your organization will then receive a check. If you have any questions, please email midatlanticcommunityrewards@kroger.com or visit our website at www.krogercommunityrewards.com to review the terms and conditions. Thank you for your continued support of your local Kroger store.

Thank you,
Community Rewards Staff
