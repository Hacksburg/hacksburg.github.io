Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-01-17_general_meeting). Tonight should be light on business. If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

Tonight at 8 PM is our next Tool Tuesday! John Lewis will be teaching us the basics of using an oscilloscope to test electronics. Admission is free -- just bring your brain.

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
