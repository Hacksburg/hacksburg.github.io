Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. We'll be discussing the upcoming plasma sword classes and contest, [laser cutter training](https://www.facebook.com/events/365447230597604/), and the [Raspberry Pi Jam](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/roanoke-raspberry-jam-raspberry-pi-big-birthday-weekend-tickets-36731256176) in Roanoke this Saturday. If you have ideas or hardware for a cool Raspberry Pi project, please bring it tonight!

As always, these meetings are free and open to the public at large, where you can get tours of the space and its equipment, ask questions about the space, see what business we conduct, and so forth. If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!
