This past weekend, Saturday May 30, Hacksburg hosted our first Hacker Unconference.

What was it? A bunch of people interested in technology who got together to talk about whatever things they were passionate about.

We ended up with the following schedule:

   *Microfluidics lab-on-a-chip
   *Cable modem crash course
   *Quad copter racing
   *Software Defined Radio
   *Discuss - how to map caves with robots
   *Camera hacking
   *Wandering about looking for Bluetooth Low Energy devices that were broadcasting

If any speakers want to let us know links to projects discussed or further materials we would be glad to link them.
