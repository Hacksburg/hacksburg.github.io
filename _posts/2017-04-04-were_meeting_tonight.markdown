Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-04-04_general_meeting). If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

As a reminder, on Saturday, April 8, from 1-4 PM, we'll be having a [prop building class](https://www.facebook.com/events/229964917471595/) at the space! Join local cosplayers Will Tilson and Cameron Woodruff as they show you how to make awesome props for your next costume! The fee is $5 for students and members, $10 for nonmembers. You will also need a prop to build from; we will have a few available for purchase.

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
