This Sunday is Hacksburg Disassembly Day! We will be going through our storage room and harvesting useful parts from the devices and equipment that have been donated to the space. If you like taking things apart (and not having to worry about putting them back together) feel free to come by the workspace between 1 and 5 PM. 

Additionally, at next week's meeting (8/7 at 7:30 PM) we will be discussing and planning upcoming events for the next few months. To keep things organized, we have created a wiki page to document and collaborate on ideas: https://wiki.hacksburg.org/events:2018:FallPlanning If you have ideas for activities you'd like to do or would be willing to lead, please add them to the wiki or bring them to the meeting!

If you can't make it to the meeting and still wish to discuss an event, please feel free to make a post on the Hacksburg Discussion email list.
