Hacksburg will be hosting a laser cutter class this Sunday. This class offers attendees a tutorial on using the Hacksburg 80W CO<sub>2</sub> Laser Cutter. Basic laser safety, design guidelines, and examples will be presented. Attendees will learn how to make their own edge-lit acrylic Valentine's Day gift (if you don't make yours holiday themed that's fine) and receive the LED base with the optional materials fee. Free for members and $5 for non-members, and a $10 optional materials fee.
