A bunch of things have happened since the last post: We're excited to announce that our new board members are Aaron Dalton and Brett Fleming!

We'll be having our weekly meeting tonight, again in the Lakeview room. Come to the front door and we'll let you in.

Check out the agenda [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2014-04-29)

If you didn't catch it earlier, we're currently able to give members 24-hour access to the space, and to the building, so bring your Hokie Passport if you have it! (If you don't have one, we'll email the CRC and get you a card from them). Those of you who needed to be added to the building access list should have been by now, but we haven't picked up new cards yet.
