Nicole Schwartz has been elected as Hacksburg's newest member of the Board of Directors. Recently, she put on Hacksburg's first Hacker Unconference, which was a smashing success; she'll be talking more about that in a later post.

This is a really exciting time for Hacksburg, and we're glad to have her aboard!
