Hello everyone! 

Steppin' Out last weekend was a huge success, and it wouldn't have been possible without our volunteers: Kurt Rooks, Mike Newsome, Ava Pope, James Dunson, Jean-Philippe Ouellet, and Hunter Morgan. Thanks to all of you!

Tonight, we'll have our general meeting at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:meeting_agenda_and_minutes_for_2015-08-11). In the interest of making room for introductions, the meeting will be light on business and heavy on interaction. We hope to see you there!
