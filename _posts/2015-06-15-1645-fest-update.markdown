This Saturday is the 8th annual [Summer Solstice Fest](http://www.downtownblacksburg.com/summer_solstice_fest.aspx) in Downtown Blacksburg 1pm- 11:30pm rain or shine. Come on out and meet us! We will have our latest projects there for you to see and interact with.

Our first project, the bike generator, is proceeding on track. Everything is hooked up and tested, and we can read the power generated by the bike and solar panel versus the load on the battery. We also have a program to display this data. Now we just need to integrate these pieces and refine it! We’ll be working on it this Tuesday after our meeting (Come meet us, 7:30pm! 2200 Kraft Drive, Suite 1475, Blacksburg, VA)

Our next project, having the 3d printer working and powered by the bike generator, has been going very well. Andrew’s solved just about all of the problems we’ve been having printing with PLA, by starting over with a bed of painter’s tape and a recalibrated Z-axis. We also got some more filament that will be in the space Tuesday. It comes in any color you want, so long as it’s black. ;)

As a note we are still looking for volunteers to help out at the Hacksburg table at the Summer Solstice Fest - volunteers who work 5 or more hours will get 5 day passes to our space! Sign up at our [doodle](http://doodle.com/9r642p2cwcedy25n#table).
