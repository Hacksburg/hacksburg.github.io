Over the last week, some equipment shuffling has been going on in Hacksburg as members who have previously loaned us equipment have since moved on to other pursuits. As such, the following equipment is no longer present in the space:

  * 3D Printer
  * Band Saw
  * Sewing Machines

We appreciate the lenders' generosity in letting us use their equipment, and we wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors. We are exploring options for replacing the equipment that the space has lost. If you are able and willing to lend the space equipment, please let the Board of Directors know by emailing board@hacksburg.org . We'd greatly appreciate any help that people can contribute.

That all being said, the space still has equipment for use. Despite the loss of the band saw, we have a multitude of tools and equipment for woodworking, including a CNC router. Furthermore, our electronics bench has been unaffected by the move. We invite everyone to come on down and see what we have to offer.

Thanks for everything you do.
