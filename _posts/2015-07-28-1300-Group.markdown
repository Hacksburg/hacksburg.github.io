We would like to announce group memberships!

Group membership is designed for organizations that would like a space to work and meet. Each organization (formal or informal) should have at least one keyholder, a primary contact for the group that holds the group's key to the space. That member is required to be in the space at all times when group members are present. Each organizational keyholder may host four (4) additional persons for a total of five (5) club members getting access to the space at a time for the membership fee.

So if your group (drone racing, rocket building, robotics, cosplay costumers etc...) needs a place to keep shared equipment, meet and work, we are your place!

More information about joining Hacksburg is located [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/membership_steps).

We are still looking for input on what equipment you would like to see at the space. [Take the survey here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-yzRpAdacqfbVivRfKMG8AKnyDMFPbki2jdvPl7oMEk/viewform)

We are also looking for volunteers for Steppin' Out! Volunteers get 5 free day passes to the space for 5 or more hours of work. [Click here](http://doodle.com/unwhdvuh2qz3qf2v) to sign up.
