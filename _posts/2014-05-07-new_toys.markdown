The image below is of the first confirmed instance of the Hacksburg logo in its physical form!

It was made using Todd Fleming's MendelMax 3d printer, which he's graciously loaning to the space. See [the wiki page](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/mendelmax) for more information.
We've also received an equally gracious loan of a [ShapeOko CNC router](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/shapeoko), from Drew Laing!

Both of these items require training before use, so be careful. But if you'd like to use one or the other, don't hesitate to ask their respective owners!

It's really terrific to have so much community involvement and so many awesome loans and donations, and we're extremely grateful to you all.
