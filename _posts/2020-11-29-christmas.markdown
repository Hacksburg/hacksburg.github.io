Hacksburgâ€™s holiday gift class includes activities for all ages to make their own personalized gifts. Gifts will include laser cut felt Christmas ornaments and laser cut wooden displays and cards. This year, attendees will request kits in advance and pick them up from Hacksburg prior to the class. The kits will be assembled at home with instructions from us in our normal online class format. You can attend the online session at https://meet.hacksburg.org/class.

The class will be held online using Jitsi Meet. Please RSVP if you're planning on attending by sending an email to [rsvp@hacksburg.org](mailto:rsvp@hacksburg.org). The stream will be available at the URL listed below.
