Hey everyone,

As a reminder, our meeting is tomorrow evening at 8pm, in one of the conference rooms of the VT Knowledgeworks buildings (probably the same one as last week, on the bridge, but we'll let you know of any changes). We will be holding board member elections this meeting, so be sure to attend! We'll have a Google hangout running as well, so you can attend virtually if you can't make it in person.

Also, we've had just two nominations for board members, so get any last minute folks nominated! If you want to have a big hand in making Hacksburg successful, this is your chance. We're looking forward to working with whomever is chosen (and hope they are too :P).

See you tomorrow!
