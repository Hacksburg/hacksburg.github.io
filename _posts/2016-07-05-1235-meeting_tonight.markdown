Hello everyone!

We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-07-05_general_meeting). As always, we'll also be talking about what we've worked on the past week, so feel free to bring your projects (or pics thereof) for show-and-tell. After the meeting, we will, as usual, have our open work session, where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on or hang out with like-minded makers.

Today is also payment and order day for the Adafruit Group Buy. If you ordered in the group buy and haven't made payment arrangements, please come tonight to do so. We will be ordering the items tonight; if all goes well, we'll have everyone's order ready by next week.

Hope to see you there!
