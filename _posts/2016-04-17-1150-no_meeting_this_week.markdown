Hello everyone! This week, Nicole Schwartz will be running two Arduino classes in coordination with Let's Code Blacksburg. 

The first of these classes will be an introductory Arduino class on Tuesday from 6-9 PM. More information on this event can be found [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/introduction_to_arduino). As such, we will not be having a Hacksburg meeting this week. If you're planning on attending, please [buy a ticket from Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/general-series-intro-to-arduino-programming-lights-knobs-for-hacksburg-tickets-24100350798). The fee is $5 for Hacksburg members, $10 for non-members. There's a maximum of 12 attendees for this class, so get in while the getting's good!

On Thursday, there will be a more advanced class on controlling lights and sound with an Arduino. This class will assume that you've used Arduino before and know how it works. The class will be from 6-9 PM and the fees are the same -- $5 for members, $10 for non-members. If you're interested, buy an Eventbrite ticket [here](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/general-series-animating-lights-and-sounds-with-arduino-for-hacksburg-tickets-24114648563). Space is limited, so sign up today!
