Hello everyone! 

We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-09-20_general_meeting). We'll be discussing upcoming events, what we did at recent events, and other things. We'll also be doing project show-and-tell, giving tours, helping each other troubleshoot projects, and answering questions about the space. If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
