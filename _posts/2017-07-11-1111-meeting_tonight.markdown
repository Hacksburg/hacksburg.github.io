Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. As always, these meetings are free and open to the public at large, where you can get tours of the space and its equipment, ask questions about the space, see what business we conduct, and so forth. If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

Tonight, we'll be discussing finances, grants, and purchasing some new equipment. Our wiki is down right now, so I don't have an agenda for everyone. I'll post here when it's back up.

**Update 2017-07-11 2:07 PM:**  The wiki is back up, and the agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-07-11_general_meeting). Thanks for your patience!
