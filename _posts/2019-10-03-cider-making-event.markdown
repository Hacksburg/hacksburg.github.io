It's Cidermaking weekend at Hacksburg!

On Saturday October 5th we'll be demonstrating the cidermaking process at the Blacksburg Farmers Market (108 W Roanoke St), from 9 am to 2pm. There will be free tastings of our freshly squeezed cider made from locally grown apples.

On October 6th we'll be hosting our [5th Annual Hacksburg Cider Making Event](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/wiki/Events/2019/5th_Annual_Cider_Pressing). Bring your own apples and containers and join us to make your own fresh squeezed apple cider. Click [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/wiki/Cider_Making) for more information about cidermaking and what to bring! Cider making is free!

Free tours of the new Hacksburg community workshop will also be offered.

Hacksburg is a makerspace. Makerspaces are community spaces with tools and people who love to create and tinker with everything from electronics, wood, metal, sewing to home brew! Come check out our community of makers.
