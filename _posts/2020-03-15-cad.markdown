Hacksburg will be hosting our 3D Printing and CAD class on Sunday, March 22. Attendees will learn about 3D printing and how to use our 3D printer.
Additionally, we will cover Autodesk Fusion 360 and basic Computer Aided Design (CAD).
More information on the class can be found on our [Wiki](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/wiki/Events/2019/3D_Printing_and_CAD).

This class will **not** be held in person to encourage social distancing related to COVID-19. The class will be held using a to-be-determined online class platform.

Please RSVP if you're planning on attending by sending an email to [rsvp@hacksburg.org](mailto:rsvp@hacksburg.org). This is how we will distribute the link to the online class so you can attend.

**Time**: March 22 from 1:00 to 4:00PM

**Location**: Online. The class instructor will not be at Hacksburg.

**Cost**: Free for members; $5 for non-members. Payment from non-members will be collected eventually on the honor system, as we cannot collect online.

**RSVP**: RSVP by emailing [rsvp@hacksburg.org](mailto:rsvp@hacksburg.org).
