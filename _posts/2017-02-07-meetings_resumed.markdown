Hello all! Now that the holidays are over, we are resuming our schedule with meetings on Tuesday at 7:30 pm unless otherwise noted.

As always, these meetings are free and open to the public at large, where you can get tours of the space and its equipment, ask questions about the space, see what business we conduct, and so forth. If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn’t know where to start, tonight’s the night to stop by!
