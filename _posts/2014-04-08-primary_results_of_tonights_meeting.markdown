We had a really productive meeting tonight, and got a lot done! We'll soon be able to give people 24-hour card access to the space. A couple very important wiki pages were created as the result of tonight's meeting, and it's important that everyone at least looks at them and is aware of them (and edits them; you can now make a wiki account for yourself!):

The first is the ["what we want" page](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/what_we_want). Add your name next to any equipment you want, and add a list item if there isn't one. We'll use this page (and the pages it points at) to decide what we want to buy, and whether we want to accept donations, so it's important that it's accurate.

The second is the [stewardship sign-up list](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:stewardship_sign-up_list), where people interested in becoming stewards sign up to be considered.

If you're interested, there's also a general [action list](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/action_list), where you can figure out what needs to get done, and who's working on it. Please also use this group to find people to work with you!

Seriously, check out those links and edit them! We need your help!
