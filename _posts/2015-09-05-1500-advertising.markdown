My original hackathon idea was to get my ubertooth working on a raspberry pi.

That idea feel through when I looked at my to do list.

I took advantage of not being at home and forced to work by working on the event scedule for Hacksburg for the next few months.

This involved:
  * Scheduling our events
    * [High Altitude Balloon Talk](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/high_altitude_balloon_talk) Tue Sept 15 8pm
    * [Virginia Science Festival](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/va_science_fair) Sat Sept 26
    * [Tea 101 Class](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/tea_101_class) Oct 3
    * [Pumpkin Carving](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/pumpkin_carving) Oct 25
  * Making [Wiki](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/) pages
  * Updating the [google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=hacksburg%40gmail.com&ctz=America/New_York)
  * Emailing the CRC (The office park in which we are located, so they can put our events in their newsletter)
  * Listing the event on events calendars
    * [BEV](https://www.bev.net/)
    * [Next Three Days](http://www.nextthreedays.com/)
    * [Eventful](http://eventful.com/events/new)
    * [Craigslist](http://blacksburg.craigslist.org) local craigslist event calendar
    * [Roanoke Paper](www.roanoke.com/calendar/) local paper
    * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) my feed
    * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/blacksburg/) local subreddit
    * [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/) my feed
    * [Google +](https://plus.google.com/) my feed
    * [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) both our group and my feed as well as making facebook events
  * Making sellable tickets for the one not free event on [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/)
  
So thats what I do to try and let people know. Have any suggestions? Was this helpful ideas for you?
