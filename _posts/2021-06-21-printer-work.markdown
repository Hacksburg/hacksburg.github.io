Got a 3D printer and have questions? Something doesn't work? Want to make your printer harder, better, faster or stronger? Want to help us improve our own printer? This event offers a shared work day for community members and Hacksburg itself to work on and improve our 3D printers. All knowledge levels welcome.

In addition to projects by attendees, Hacksburg will be working on upgrading our own Creality CR-10 S4.
We will be upgrading to an AC heated bed and Volcano hotend to be able to print high temperature materials and print more quickly.

This workshop will be held in-person! Vaccinated people who would like to attend without a mask need to bring their CDC COVID-19 vaccination card, if we haven't checked yours already. Everyone else needs to bring a mask or other suitable face covering.

**Time**: June 27 from 1:00PM to 4:00PM (or whenever the last Hacksburg member leaves)

**Location**: Hacksburg; 1872 Pratt Drive Suite 1700 (the laser room). Park and enter at back of the building, there is construction going on in the front.

**Cost**: Free!

**RSVP**: No RSVP required.
