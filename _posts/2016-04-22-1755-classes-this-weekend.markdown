Hello! This weekend, we're hosting three classes at the space. First, tomorrow at 1 PM, Kurt Rooks will be doing a basic woodworking class. If you've ever wanted to take advantage of our extensive wood shop but didn't know where to start or were intimidated by the equipment, this class is for you! The cost for this class will be $10 for the public, $5 for students, and free for Hacksburg members.

On Sunday, Nicole Schwartz will be having a fabric class double-header! First, at 4 PM, she'll lead a Sewing 101 class. She'll be covering how to read a pattern  basic care and feeding of a sewing machine, and how to make simple projects. As part of the course, everyone will be making a drawstring bag to take home with them! The cost for this class is $15 for the public, $10 for students, and $5 for Hacksburg members.

Then, at 6 PM, Nicole will teach a soft circuits class. She'll show you how to use conductive threads, fabric, LEDs and processors to create wearable electronics! As part of the class, everyone will get to make a soft circuit to take home! The cost for this class will be $20 for the public, $15 for students, and $10 for Hacksburg members.

**A note for people coming to the classes:** Because of several events on campus this weekend, we do not advise coming to Hacksburg via Beamer Way and Tech Center Drive. Instead, we advise either taking the US 460 bypass to Industrial Park Road/Ramble Road and then Kraft Drive, or taking Main Street to Airport Drive and then Kraft Drive.

Hope to see people there!
