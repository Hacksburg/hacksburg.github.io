Hacksburg has partnered with the Lightsaber Club at Virginia Tech to hold a lightsaber making class. Build a movie-set-grade lightsaber with a full color blade, motion sound effects, and sturdy construction for lightsaber battles! You will machine the hilt out of aluminum, solder the electronics, and assemble the blade over several sessions.
Non-members can sign up for a timeslot to come into Hacksburg to work, and members can work at any time.
