Hello everyone! 

Tonight, we'll have our general meeting at 7:30 PM at the space. I wish I could put an agenda here, but unfortunately our wiki is currently down, and will likely remain so until this evening when I take a look at the server. However, for everyone's information, the two main topics of discussion include upcoming events and what our fundraising priorities will be with our new 501(c)(3) status. As always, we'll also be talking about what we've worked on the past week, so feel free to bring your projects (or pics thereof) for show-and-tell. After the meeting, we will, as usual, have our open work session, where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on or hang out with like-minded makers.

As a reminder, the next class in our cosplay series will be this Saturday (April 9th) from Noon-2 PM. This time, local cosplayer and makeup artist Chris DeHart will be holding a Makeup and Prosthetics Workshop. Cost is $10 for the public, $5 for students, and free for members. We hope you can join us!

**Update (4/5 6:49 PM):** The wiki is back up, and the agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-04-05_general_meeting).
