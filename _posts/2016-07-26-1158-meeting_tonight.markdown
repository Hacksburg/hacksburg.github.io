Hello everyone!

We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-07-26_general_meeting). As always, we'll also be talking about what we've worked on the past week, so feel free to bring your projects (or pics thereof) for show-and-tell. After the meeting, we will, as usual, have our open work session, where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on or hang out with like-minded makers. Hope to see you there!

Also, the VT Corporate Research Center's [Tenant and Family Picnic](http://vtcrc.com/events/2016picnic) will be on August 12th from 5-8 PM at the CRC Administration Building (1715 Pratt Drive). Admission is free to members, but you need a wristband from us to attend. We need to have the form in by August 5, so if you're a member and you want to go, please let us know by next week's meeting (August 2nd).
