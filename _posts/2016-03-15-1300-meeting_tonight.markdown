Hello everyone! 

Tonight, we'll have our general meeting at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-03-15_general_meeting). 

In addition to discussing upcoming events, we'll be distributing the things people bought in our Adafruit group buy. Don't forget to bring any recent projects (or pictures) to show off in our "What you are working on" section.

After the meeting, we will, as usual, have our open work session, where you can get help with a project you're roadblocked on or hang out with like-minded makers. We hope you can join us!
