Remember back in July we had a homebrew class?

The beers are now ready!

During the class we brewed [Star Spangled Chai Milk Stout](https://github.com/NicoleSchwartz/HomeBrewing/wiki/Star-Spangled-Chai-Milk-Stout), racked [Lady Devotea India Pale Ale](https://github.com/NicoleSchwartz/HomeBrewing/wiki/Lady-Devotea-IPA-%28lavender-earl-grey%29) and bottled some home made rootbeer.

If you wanted to read any of the handouts from the class they can be found [here](https://github.com/NicoleSchwartz/HomeBrewing).

You can see the pictures from the class [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNiW_W3ivFVBsUuOptKTzz8iVIbV_INFZeRW7VCYIDpz9eL2zRd7CNDlbTtSd53KA?key=NFlXYmZ0WjRZazl2MFB6dWVkOENlQVMzRGlPc193)

Class participants can pickup their beers at tonight's meeting!

We held the beverage cooling competition after the class - there are pictures [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMH-0U98ARPJpflA9k-ApgaCdJqM_OMg5sIA3FWEWtVXzIIHYq-yhtft9VhIAqjWA?key=U1VpMHBHNTRBenZMaGp5VDA2Sk1fY19DeFllbW53) sadly none of the contraptions was able to produce cups of beer fast enough! (rules were [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/events:2015:beverage_cooling_competition)) they were however cool enough, even freezing at one point! Perhaps next year?
