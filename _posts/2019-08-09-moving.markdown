Hacksburg is moving within the Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center (VT CRC). Our new address will be the Garvin building, 
1872 Pratt Drive, Suite 1700 and 1620 (1700 is the main room). We have been working hard on the moving process and reached the 
point where our weekly meetings will now be held in the new space. Some work will still get done in the old space, but most 
equipment has been moved over, and card access is working in the Garvin building and the main room. We hope to see you at our first
Tuesday meeting in the new space on **August 13** at **7:30PM**. The front and rear doors will be staffed to help people find the new space.

Note that our address is written in a lot of places, and it will take us time to find and correct all of them. Hacksburg members retain
access to the old space. Please email [board@hacksburg.org](mailto:board@hacksburg.org) if you have any questions.
