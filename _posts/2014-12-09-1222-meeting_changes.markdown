We're going to be changing up our schedule a bit, starting this week. Instead of having open work sessions and business meetings on alternate weeks, we'll be having shorter business meetings and work sessions every week. We also have been holding regular meetings of the Board of Directors, and people are allowed to attend those as well. We've already made changes to our Google Calendar.

Here's how our regular schedule will work:

  * 7 PM -- Board Meeting
  * 7:30 PM  -- Business Meeting
  * 8 PM -- Work Session

Here's our rationale for this:

  * Not many people seem interested in coming to business meetings, and that's OK; we don't expect everyone to be involved in every aspect of Hacksburg business. But at the same time, we need an opportunity to discuss business and allow for input. In addition, there's usually not much on the agenda. In light of this, shortening the meetings and moving them up makes sense.
  * We're starting to get more collaborative projects going -- the recent 3D printer project is one example -- and we need more time to accomodate them. This will also function as our Open Work Session for anyone not interested in the project of the week. 
  * We want to make Board decisions a bit more transparent, and we've been wanting to do public meetings from the beginning. Before now, our meetings have been irregular and at-need, so it was hard to set a schedule around them. We hope this improves things. However, there will be times when we will need to have non-public meetings, to deal with cases where we need to deal with sensitive or legally privileged information. In addition, we ask that people not disrupt Board Meetings while they're in progress so that we can get things done quickly.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to ask here or let the Board know (board@hacksburg.org).
