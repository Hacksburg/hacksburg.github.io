January 17th 8:00pm we are having our monthly Hacksburg Tool Tuesday - Introduction to the Oscilloscope

Come on out to Hacksburg's monthly Tool Tuesday and learn what an Oscilloscope is, what uses it has, and the basics of operating it.

This event is open to everyone (students, residents, anyone!) and free.

This event will follow our normal weekly meeting (which starts at 7:30pm) and will be followed by our weekly open work session - both of which are always open to anyone! A great time to get a tour or be able to sit down and work on a project.

2200 Kraft Drive, Suite 1475, Blacksburg, VA
(go all the way to the right end of the parking lot, where the trash disposal is and a bay door - we're the bay door!)
