Hi folks! Just a quick update on what's going on with Hacksburg.

First, great news! Our insurance was approved, and so was our Blacksburg business license. This means the final hurdles to starting the hackerspace have been cleared, and we can finally get to work on building the space and making things!

Our first event at the new space, as mentioned last time, is our move-in day, which is tomorrow (3/22) from 11 AM to 7 PM. Here, we'll be touching up the space a bit, moving in furniture and any large donated tools, and making sure things are set for our grand opening the following week. Anyone who helps us out will get free food and our eternal gratitude. :-)

The space is at 2200 Kraft Drive (aka KnowledgeWorks I), Suite 1475 -- the one with the big garage door facing Kraft Drive. Plug the address into your preferred navigation software for better directions.

It's been a long and tumultuous journey, but the end of this part is almost upon us, and the next leg will be more fun. Come join us!
