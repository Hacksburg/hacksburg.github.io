Hello everyone!  We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2017-05-09_general_meeting). If you were curious about Hacksburg but didn't know where to start, tonight's the night to stop by!

We'd also like to announce that we will be having a booth at Blacksburg's Summer Solstice Fest on June 17th! At this point, we're looking for volunteers; if you can help us out by chipping in a few hours of your time, please sign up on the Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bIzbywxSBwDcmI_cKEa8fh9w5_eL84KqhIe3gdHiOJU/edit#gid=0).

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
