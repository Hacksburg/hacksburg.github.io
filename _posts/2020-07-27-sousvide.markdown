Hacksburg will be hosting a new class this Sunday, Sous Vide 101. Sous vide is a new cooking method becoming more popular all the time.
Sous vide uses a precisely controlled water bath to cook foods. This seals in flavor and practically removes the 'time' part of 'time and temperature' -- it's almost impossible to overcook with sous vide.

Sous vide cooking can be done by combining basic parts or buying a premade unit. Don't know which one you want? This class is for you!
The class will cover the basics of sous vide cooking along with the pros and cons or assembling a controller.

This class will not be held in person to encourage social distancing related to COVID-19. The class will be held using Jitsi Meet.
