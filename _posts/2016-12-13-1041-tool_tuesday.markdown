Hello everyone! 

We're having a general meeting tonight at 7:30 PM at the space. The agenda is [here](https://wiki.hacksburg.org/meetings:2016-12-13_general_meeting). We have a lot to discuss tonight, including our new and upcoming communications.

In addition, tonight at 8 PM will be our first Tool Tuesday! This regular event will showcase a tool or piece of equipment at the space, showing how it works, what you can do with it, and so on. Tonight, Will Tilson will be demonstrating the metal lathe, and what interesting projects you can do with it. It should be fun, so come on down!

Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you tonight!
