Work on Hacksburg's new 3D printer continues! We don't have much hardware at this point, so this will be more discussion about what kind of 3D printer we want to build.

Some possible models and discussion on them are available [here](http://wiki.hacksburg.org/the_search_for_a_3d_printer).

We look forward to seeing you there!
