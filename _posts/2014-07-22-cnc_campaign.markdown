Our latest project needs funding! We want to build a large CNC Router (4'x4'), and we've launched another [Indiegogo Campaign](http://igg.me/at/hacksburg-cnc)! Please, check it out and spread the word! Every bit of help we can get makes our space better, so even if you can't contribute to the campaign, you can still help us by telling your friends, lending a hand at the space, and even becoming a member. :)
