Do you like robots? How about rockets? What about simply making things? If youâ€™re a maker, creator, or tinkerer, come check out Hacksburg at our open house on November 8th. The event runs from 1pm to 6pm, and is located at our space (2200 Kraft Dr, Suite 1475 in Blacksburg). We'll be giving demos of various projects that we've been working on, and would be happy to give you the floor if you had any projects to share with attendees.
