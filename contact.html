  <h2><a href="/contact.html">Contact Us</a></h2>
    <h3>Direct Email</h3>
    <p>People needing to speak to someone "in charge" (donation offers, media requests, outside event proposals, business collaborations, etc) should email the Board of Directors at <span style="font-family: monospace;">board at hacksburg dot org</span>. Messages are checked often, and a Board member will get back to you as soon as they can.</p>
    
    <h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
    <p>We have two public mailing lists to peruse:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>>We have <a href="http://eepurl.com/b902Fr">our Mailchimp list</a> where we post blog posts and announcements. This is one of the best ways to keep abreast of what's happening at the space.</li>
        <li>We have our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/hacksburg.org/forum/#!forum/discussion">public discussion list</a>, where our community comes to discuss things related to Hacksburg, the Maker movement, and so on. Membership is open to anyone, but spam is highly discouraged.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As time goes on, we may have more mailing lists for things like project groups. Check this space for more details.</p>
    
    <h3>Facebook</h3>
    <p>We have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/405322866198425/">a very active Facebook group</a> where a lot of our community hangs out and discusses various topics related to making things. If you have a question for the community, posting it here is your best bet to get a response. Membership in the Hacksburg Facebook group is open to anyone, though you need to be approved by a group administrator first, to cut down on spam.</p>
    <p>We also have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hacksburg/">a separate Facebook page for Hacksburg</a>, where we post announcements. We do receive messages from here, but response time is slower than email; if your need is urgent, email is your better bet.</p>
    
    <h3>Twitter</h3>
    <p>We have <a href="https://twitter.com/hacksburg">a Twitter feed</a> where we post announcements and converse with other tweeters.</p>
    
    <h3>Dead Tree Mail</h3>
    <p>People wanting to send us letters or packages should use the following address:</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Hacksburg<br />
    2200 Kraft Drive Suite 1475<br />
    Blacksburg VA 24060</p>
    
    <h3>In Person</h3>
    <p>If you need to get hold of someone in person, we hold open-to-the-public meetings and work sessions at the space every Tuesday starting from 7:30 PM to whenever the last member leaves. You will most often find at least one Board member there and a few regulars. Not everyone attends every meeting, so if you need to meet with someone in particular, you should contact them ahead of time and see if they'll be there.</p>
