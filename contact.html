    <h3>Email</h3>
    <p>People needing to speak to someone "in charge" (donation offers, media requests, outside event proposals, etc) should email the Board of Directors at <span style="font-family: monospace;">board at hacksburg dot org</span>. Messages are checked often, and a Board member will get back to you as soon as they can.</p>
    
    <h3>Mailing List</h3>
    <p>We have <a href="http://eepurl.com/b902Fr">a mailing list through Mailchimp</a> where we post blog posts and announcements. This is one of the best ways to keep abreast of what's happening at the space.</p>
    
    <h3>Facebook</h3>
    <p>We have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/405322866198425/">a very active Facebook group</a> where a lot of our community hangs out and discusses various topics related to making things. If you have a question for the community, posting it here is your best bet to get a response. Membership in the Hacksburg Facebook group is open to anyone, though you need to be approved by a group administrator first, to cut down on spam.</p>
    <p>We also have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hacksburg/">a separate Facebook page for Hacksburg</a>, where we post announcements. We do receive messages from here, but response time is slower than email; if your need is urgent, email is your better bet.</p>
    
    <h3>Twitter</h3>
    <p>We have <a href="https://twitter.com/hacksburg">a Twitter feed</a> where we post announcements and converse with other tweeters.</p>
