    <h3>Who are we?</h3>

    <p>Hacksburg is Blacksburg's first makerspace. Started in 2014, we're
    a community workshop focused on enabling members of the Blacksburg 
    community to complete projects that would otherwise be out of reach.
    Whether you need equipment, mentorship, or just some help, Hacksburg is
    meant to be a useful resource for building anything from rockets to robots
    to rocking chairs.</p>

    <p>As you can see in the map on the sidebar, our space is located in the 
    Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center, and we wouldn't exist in our
    current form without their support. </p>
