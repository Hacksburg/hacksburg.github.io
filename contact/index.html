										If you need to speak to someone "in charge" (general inquiries, donation offers, media requests, outside event proposals, business collaborations, etc.), email Hacksburg's board of directors at <a href="mailto:board@hacksburg.org">board@hacksburg.org</a>. Messages are checked often, and a board member will get back to you as soon as they can.

										Hacksburg's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/405322866198425/?mibextid=6NoCDW">Facebook group</a> is where a lot of our community comes to discuss topics related to making things. If you have a question for our community, posting it here is a great way to get a response. Membership in Hacksburg's Facebook group is open to anyone, but you must be approved by a group administrator first (to cut down on spam).<br><br>
Hacksburg also has a separate <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hacksburg/">Facebook page</a> where we post announcements. We do receive messages here, but response time is generally slower than email.

											If you'd like to talk to someone in person (or just take a tour of the space), we hold open-to-the-public meetings and work sessions at Hacksburg every Tuesday from 7:30pm to whenever the last member leaves. You'll usually find at least one board member at these meetings, along with several regulars. Not everyone attends every meeting, so if you'd like to speak with someone in particular, you should contact them ahead of time to make sure they plan to attend.
<br><br>
You can also attend Hacksburg's weekly meetings <a href="https://meet.hacksburg.org/OpenGroupMeeting">remotely</a>.
