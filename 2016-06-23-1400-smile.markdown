Did you know that you can donate to Hacksburg (we are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit) when you shop using [Amazon Smile](https://smile.amazon.com/)? If you lready have smile you just need to [update your charity](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/homepage/ref=smi_se_scyc_srch_stsr?q=hacksburg&orig=%2F).

Also - for those like myself who forget to go to "smile.amazon.com" - use one of these extensions for your web browser to make it harder to forget to shop using Smile!
  * [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smile-always/jgpmhnmjbhgkhpbgelalfpplebgfjmbf?hl=en)
  * [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amazonsmileredirector/)
  * [Safari](http://distrustsimplicity.net/articles/keep-on-smiling/)

As always we also accept donations through [Give Big NRV](https://cfnrv.givebig.org/c/NRV/Search?p=1&keyword=hacksburg), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KVUGMTXUKKPAQ), cash/checks, and donations of equipment.
