  <h2>Support Hacksburg</h2>
    <p>Hacksburg is Blacksburg’s first makerspace: a community workshop offering tools, training, and mentorship enabling the NRV community to innovate, educate, and create. Hacksburg also offers a variety of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) classes and events to community members of all ages, such as building basic electric circuits, 3D printing, cider making, and basic woodworking to name just a few.</p>
    <p>Hacksburg is a 501c3 non-profit organization, fully funded through membership fees, donations, and grants. Through your support Hacksburg can provide greater opportunities to the Blacksburg community while helping to educate the next generation of inventors and creators. You can help support Hacksburg's mission without spending a cent through Amazon Smile, Kroger Community Rewards, or through the donation of tools and equipment.</p>
