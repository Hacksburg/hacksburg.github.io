  <p>In addition to recieving a fun project, your purchase helps support Hacksburg, a local non-profit organization. As with many local groups and buisnesses, Hacksburg has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to stay-at-home orders, Hacksburg was forced to close our workshop to the public. The group also spent many hours and hundreds of dollars to produce PPE for local medical professionals and first responders. You can read more about Hacksburg's COVID-19 response <a href="/covid-19.html">here</a>.</p>
