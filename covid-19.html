  <h3>What is happening?</h3>

  <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a nationwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) which medical professionals and first responders require to safely treat patients and protect themselves from the virus. While they would prefer to use commercially manufactured PPE, in this emergency they are looking for alternative sources, including makerspaces like Hacksburg.</p>

  <h3>What is Hacksburg doing?</h3>
  <p>Hacksburg is working with community organizers to produce PPE for local hopitals, clinics, and first responders using the tools in the workshop. Hacksburg is making <a href="https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013306">face shields</a> and <a href="https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013931">"ear-savers"</a> based off of both NIH approved designs and custom designs that improve production efficiency or meet specific end-user needs. To date, Hacksburg has produced almost 2000 pieces of PPE.</p>

  <h3>How can you help?</h3>
  <p>Hacksburg's most critical need at this time is materials for producing face shield headbands. If you know of someone that may be able to donate any of the following materials, please contact the Hacksburg Board of Directors: <a href="mailto:board@hacksburg.org">board@hacksburg.org</a></p>
  <ul>
    <li>3/16" Polypropylene</li>
    <li>3/16" HIPS/PS</li>
    <li>3/16" Acrylic (cast or extruded)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can also help Hackburg produce PPE through a monetary donation. All donations recieved by Hacksburg during the duration of the COVID-19 emergency will be used to purchase materials for producing PPE. Any amount can help: a donation of $10 can purchase materials for 7 headbands or 300 "ear-savers".</p>
